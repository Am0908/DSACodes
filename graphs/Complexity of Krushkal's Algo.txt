ALGORITHM:

1. Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.
2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far. If cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it.
3. Repeat step#2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.


Complexity of Krushkal's algorithm :  Union find

1. Take input -  O(E)

2. Sort input array - O(E log E)

3. cycle detection (parent figureout) -  O(v)

4. pick n-1 edges and put in MST -  O(E * V)

Total time complexity - O(E log E + E * V)

Alternate option : union by rank & path compression.
time complexity - O(E log E + E log V)
