STEP 1: Make a boolean array to know if the vertices has been visited or not;
STEP 2: Make a distance array to store the shortest distances of the vertices from the vertex 0;
STEP 3: Initially set all the distances to infinite and visited to false;
STEP 4: set Distance of vertex 0 to 0;
STEP 5: For 0 to n-1

        int minvertex = findminvertex (distance, visited, n);
        visited[minvertex] = true;

        explore all the neighbours of minvertex using for loop.
        for j = 0 to j = n
            if(edges[minvertex][j] != 0 && !Visited[j])
            {
            int dist = distance[minvertex] + edges[minvertex][j];
            if(dist < distance[j])
            distance[j] =  dist;
            }

STEP 5: Print the result using for loop i.e. print i and distance[i]
STEP 6: Delete the visited and distance arrays.
